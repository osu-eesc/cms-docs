Most of these apply to the Extension website and elsewhere, such as OSU WordPress blogs and college or department websites. Planning and Evaluating Content Before you enter content, you should evaluate whether that content is appropriate to put online. All content should: Have a purpose or goal that aligns with your team\u2019s strategy Have a defined audience and be appropriate for that audience Align with the digital strategy\u2019s requirements and guiding principles Structured : entered in a format that makes sense and is consistent Atomic : separated into the smallest sensible pieces Customer-focused : uses language and concepts that are familiar to visitors Mobile-friendly : deliverable to a variety of screen sizes without degradation Data-informed : creation and development based on available data Relevant : information is up-to-date and meets visitors\u2019 needs Right people doing right things : written, reviewed, entered, and maintained by the appropriate people and groups Not duplicate content that already exists online Before entering content into the Extension website, please use the Site Content Overview page to make sure it doesn\u2019t already exist. If the content you want to enter already exists, contact the person who uploaded it and ask them to make the necessary edits. See Working with Other Content Authors . If the content is on another website, consider linking to it instead. Writing for the Web Many Extension faculty and staff are skilled in academic research writing or in writing program materials. This type of content often needs to be altered to accommodate the way that people use information online. Here are some tips for writing effective web content: Keep it as short as possible. Remove words, sentences, paragraphs, and pages that aren\u2019t necessary. Separate content into chunks using lists, headings, and paragraph breaks. Don\u2019t over-emphasize. When everything on a page is emphasized, nothing stands out. Avoid overuse of bold, italics, and large or colored fonts. The best way to bring attention to something is to have less other stuff on the page to compete with it (see the first tip). Use good writing style as you would with any other piece of writing. Use proper spelling and grammar. Try to use active verbs. Begin a piece with something interesting and lead with important points. Make titles descriptive and compelling. Limit acronyms and jargon. Use clear language by writing simple, straightforward descriptions whenever possible, especially when translation is not an option. This also makes content more usable for youth, people with low-literacy, English language learners, and people with certain learning or intellectual disabilities. Hemingway App is a good tool to check the readability of your content. The Plain Language guide also provides other tips. Set up a review process so that content stays up to date and is accurate. (For some content teams, this may include peer review.) Follow OSU and Extension brand guidelines. The OSU Brand Guide and the Extension Style Guide have information about messaging and tone for written pieces. Here is a quick summary of the differences between writing for print media and writing for the web: Topic Print version Web version Access \u201cPrint-friendly PDF\u201d button on the website Remember, our audience is literally reading this on a phone. Reading level Write to 10th-to 12th-grade reading level Write to 8th-to 12th-grade reading level Audience segment Write to clearly identified section of audience: producers, stewards, advocates, learners Write to clearly identified section of audience: producers and learners Length Flexible length 50% shorter. For longer articles, include an overview or summary. Tables Complex tables OK Simpler tables with accessible HTML Design standards Meets print design standards (High resolution, lots of images, data graphics). Widows, line breaks, and alignment matter. Good visual hierarchy. Meets web design standards (lower resolution with alt text, screen readable). Teaser text to draw in readers. Tagging/keywords added. Structure More flexible narrative format, but use short sentences. Inverted pyramid style preferable. Lead with the most important points, or make important points stand out with pull quotes or separate lines. Headlines Compelling headlines Headlines front-load keywords. They\u2019re straightforward and compelling, not cutesy. Shorter is better. Sections Break up text with photos, graphics and subheads Break content into short, readable chunks. Liberal use of subheads, bullet points and boldface. Voice and tone Voice and tone: depends on complexity of topic. Avoid passive voice. Voice and tone reflect OSU branding. Welcoming, helpful, conscientious, progressive. Okay to use second person pronouns. References Include resources and references at the end using AP or Chicago style for citations Link to other relevant content (but never say \u201cclick here\u201d) Acronyms Acronyms OK. (Chicago Style) Limit acronyms Sentences Full sentences required. Phrases and partial sentences okay. Content Storytelling and illustrative examples common. Specific actionable information preferred (unless a story or news content type). Based on UX research from Nielson Norman Group . Diversity and Inclusion OSU\u2019s Strategic Plan 4.0 places a strong emphasis on promoting diversity and inclusion in education and programs. There are several things to keep in mind to ensure that our web content is inclusive of all the audiences we serve. Accessibility Accessibility means that content is available to and used by a diverse variety of visitors. Often, it specifically refers to making a site useable by people with disabilities. However, it can also apply to others, including: People using small screens on mobile devices English-language learners and automatic translators that may be used by non-English speakers People of diverse ages Non-human visitors to the site, such as search engine crawlers As an institution that receives federal funding, we are legally required to make content and services accessible . See OSU\u2019s IT Accessibility Policy . Here are some guidelines to make sure content is accessible: Use text editor controls for what they were intended. Many assistive technologies depend on text formatting to give structure and meaning to content. Therefore, it\u2019s important to use formatting only when appropriate. For example, don\u2019t create a \u201cfake\u201d heading by just making text bold. On the other hand, don\u2019t use the heading formatting (e.g. Heading 2, Heading 3) just to emphasize text. Headings should reflect the structure of the content. Don\u2019t put important text in images. People with visual impairments can have trouble reading text that is part of an image. Text in images also cannot be translated by automatic translators or scanned by search engines. Text in images such as event flyers and diagrams should also be typed in another field on the content, such as the description field on an event. If you must put text in an image, also type that text in the image\u2019s alternative (\u201calt\u201d) text field. Use meaningful labels for links. It is important that the text in a link makes sense and describes what the link does. If the link gets broken, you will find it easier to locate the resource again if the link includes the title of the missing page. Assistive technologies often read link text by itself to help speed up browsing. Also, search engine crawlers put more weight on keywords in link text. You should never use a \u201craw\u201d URL. For example, instead of \u201cwww.google.com,\u201d use \u201cGoogle.\u201d See Using the Site for how to create links in text areas. The same thing applies to email addresses. Instead of \u201cContact Jane Doe at jane.doe@oregonstate.edu,\u201d just put \u201cContact Jane Doe.\u201d We also encourage you to link to a person\u2019s profile instead of an email address if possible (type their name in the link field and select from the list that shows up). This has several benefits: Makes it less likely for spam bots to find and abuse the email address. Profile links go to an online form which results in less errors than clicking on an email link. Profiles also give several methods of getting in touch with someone for visitors that prefer one method over the others. Avoid links that contain the phrase \u201cClick here.\u201d This is not descriptive enough and is inaccurate for people who are not using a mouse. Avoid text in all caps. This makes text difficult to pronounce for screen readers (they may mistake it for an acronym). It is also more difficult to read for people with dyslexia. Use tables only for tabular data. Tables are complex structures that are difficult for assistive technologies to understand. Only use them when necessary\u2014for example, when presenting tabular data. Don\u2019t use tables for formatting text in columns. Two-column sections on pages can accomplish this. Here are some more University resources to help you create accessible electronic content: Accessible Electronic Documents (PDFs, Microsoft Word Documents, etc.) Accessible Web Pages OSU\u2019s Web and Mobile Services offers \u201cAccessibility Basics for the Web\u201d trainings that content authors should consider attending. Accessibility considerations for remote Extension programming and content Other Strategies While accessibility makes sure that all people can access content, there are other things we need to do to make sure content is appropriate and inclusive once the reader has found it. Content creation : When creating content, recognize different perspectives and include topics that are relevant to diverse communities. Free access : If you are publishing content in academic journals, consider publications that do not require a subscription to read. That way everyone can have access when you link to it from the website. OSU\u2019s Open Access policy passed by the Faculty Senate in 2013 retains copyright to the post-peer review, pre-typeset versions of faculty articles so that they can be made available in open access repositories like ScholarsArchive@OSU and on the Extension website. This also includes articles where OSU is only one of the authors. Content translation : Provide materials if needed to non-English speaking populations, and tag content with the language it is written in. In the next phase of development, Extension Communications will investigate the possibility of implementing an automatic translation service for the website. Images : Make sure the images you take and use reflect the diversity of your audience. Also be mindful that your images aren\u2019t inadvertently sending negative messages or reinforcing stereotypes. Pronouns : Be respectful of your subjects\u2019 and visitors\u2019 pronouns. You can specify your own pronouns on your user profile. See Adding and Editing Content: User Profile . For resources, trainings, and answers to questions related to diversity and inclusion, visit the Outreach & Engagement Diversity, Equity and Inclusion website . Tagging Guidelines Tags are labels applied to content to help with sorting, filtering, and interpretation. They provide contextual information about the content that various platforms can take advantage of to display or use the content in ways that make sense. For example, a smart home app could use region tags to find information that is applicable to the home\u2019s location. Or, if a website knows that a user is interested in a particular topic, it can feature content tagged with that topic for that user. In general, when tagging a piece of content, think about how a visitor to the site would want to find the content. Here are some more detailed guidelines for the individual tags you can add to content. Topic When you tag content with a topic, a few things will happen. The content will show up on the topic\u2019s pages. The content will show higher in search results when a visitor searches for the topic. The content will show when a visitor selects the topic in a page filter. A link to the topic page will show at the end of the content (unless it you override it with a custom \"Call to Action\") The content will appear in a \u201cRelated Content\u201d section on pages of other pieces of content tagged with the topic. Try to limit the topics you tag content with to one or two that are most relevant. For example, if you have a newsletter that has a whole article on tree care then that would be good topic to add. If you just had a brief mention of a tree care event coming up, then do not add it. The event on the website will be tagged for the topic but not the whole newsletter. Topic Category Topic committees are able to configure specific topic categories per topic. For example, for the \"Berries, table grapes and kiwifruit\" topic, there are categories for \"Berries\", \"Table Grapes\", and \"Kiwifruit\". These are used to further organize content in a topic. Keyword When you tag content with a keyword, a few things will happen. The content will show higher in search results when a visitor searches for the keyword. The content will show when a visitor selects the keyword in a page filter The content will show in \u201cProgram Tagged Content\u201d page sections for programs it is tagged with. Keywords are the only tag on the site that requires content authors to type in the tag instead of selecting it. Please follow these guidelines while doing this: Reuse existing keywords if possible. As you type in the keyword box, you can select matching keywords that already exist. You will know you are reusing an existing keyword if a number appears next to it (this is the numeric ID of that keyword). Keywords need to be separated by a comma. Use all-lowercase letters unless the keyword contains a proper noun. Try to use nouns whenever possible (instead of adjectives or verbs), for example, \u201csustainability\u201d instead of \u201csustainable.\u201d Only use one \u201cform\u201d of each keyword. For example, don\u2019t tag a piece of content with both \u201capple\u201d and \u201capples.\u201d Don\u2019t repeat information in other fields. For example, if you have tagged content with the region \u201cCentral Oregon,\u201d you don\u2019t need to add it as a keyword. Avoid acronyms. Use keywords that could apply to more than one piece of content. Each keyword should contain a single idea. For example, instead of \u201ctrees and shrubs,\u201d use the separate keywords \u201ctrees\u201d and \u201cshrubs.\u201d Region The region tag can narrow content down to only what is relevant for someone in a particular geographical area. When you tag content with a region, a few things will happen: The content will show up higher when a visitor searches for the region. The content will show when a visitor selects the region in a page filter. The region tag defaults to \u201cStatewide.\u201d You should change this tag (remove \u201cStatewide\u201d and add a different region) only if the content is only applicable to one or more specific regions and not statewide. Season The season tag specifies the season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) when the content is relevant. This is used for internal organization and for promotion of seasonally-relevant content. If content is equally-relevant during the entire year, do not select any season. Marketing Theme Extension marketing developed four themes to describe the work we do to stakeholders. If your content fits within one of these themes, specify it with the \u201cmarketing theme\u201d tag. Program Area The Program Area tag is used on county focus areas for internal organization. Mark which of the seven Extension program areas that the focus area fits under. Audience The audience tag is used for internal organization, and the list of available audiences is currently under development. Eventually, it will be used to help personalize the website experience for individual visitors. If the content is not aimed at any of the listed audiences, do not select any. Language The language tag specifies what language the content is available in. When you tag content with a language, a few things will happen. The content will show higher in search results when a visitor searches for the language. The content will show when a visitor selects the language in a page filter. In the upcoming phase of development for the website, there will be more robust multilingual functionality. In the meantime, we are using language tags for reporting and auditing information. Please only tag content with a language if the content is actually in that language. Program and County Tagging a piece of content with a program or county generally makes it appear on the corresponding program or county page. When you do this, please be mindful of whether your content is relevant to visitors to that page. Case Study: Tags on an Article The article \u201c Start Planning Early: Things to consider when selling trees from your property \u201d is tagged as follows: Topics: Forest Health and Management; Cutting and Selling Trees Shows on both topic pages: Forest Health and Management , Cutting and Selling Trees Keywords: logging, timber harvest, clear cut, thinning Shows when topic pages are filtered Shows in search results for keywords Region: Statewide Language : (none) Program : Master Woodland Manager If the MWM program had a \u201cProgram Tagged Content List\u201d section configured, this article would show up there Case Study: Tags on an Event The event \u201c 4-H Annual Western Region Livestock Education Day \u201d is tagged with a number of counties and local 4-H programs. This is because it is applicable to the entire Western region of the state. It shows up on the pages for each county and program it is tagged with. Note that, because it was added through the Linn County 4-H group, it does not need to be tagged with the Linn County 4-H program to show up on that page. Legal Requirements There are a few things to keep in mind to make sure the content you enter in the site meets legal requirements. Copyrighted Content It is very important that you only enter content in the site that we have the rights to or have permission to share or use. This includes text, documents, images (see above), and other media. If you want to share content that is owned by another organization, you can link to it from our site (for example, as an online resource). Research in Journals and other Publications When considering adding content created by Extension faculty/staff that has been published in an external journal or other non-OSU publication, be sure to consider copyright and fair use. Authors may retain their copyright but be limited in their ability to share or distribute the work. Scholars Archive @ OSU has good information about this . Here are some methods to consider for sharing this kind of content. You can link to the content if the journal where you submitted it provides it through open access. This is usually explained somewhere in the journal. If it\u2019s unclear, then you need to determine whether sharing the content falls under fair use. You could likely provide it to individuals on request for educational purposes, but providing it through a website would not typically be considered fair use. You may consider repurposing the information in the content to create a new product that you are allowed to share and that is more appropriate for a web audience. Accessibility As an institution that receives federal funding, we are legally required to make content and services accessible. See the Accessibility section above for more information about how to do this. You can also read OSU\u2019s IT Accessibility Policy . Non-Discrimination and Accessibility Statement The Equal Opportunity/Accessibility statement is linked to at the bottom of every page on the Extension website. Therefore, it is not required for content that shows on web pages (website-based content). However, files (for example, newsletters) may be downloaded and viewed outside of the website, so you may need to include one or both of these statements. You can read more information here . Review of Terms Accessibility : a diverse variety of visitors can access the content Tags : labels applied to content to provide context and clues to meaning. Various platforms can use the contextual information tags provide to display or use the content in ways that make sense. Key Takeaways Make sure content you enter in the site has been reviewed and evaluated for quality and compliance with Extension\u2019s digital strategy. It is required that Extension\u2019s web content be accessible to people with disabilities. Only enter content (including text, documents, and images) that you own or have permission to use.","title":"Content Requirements and Best Practices"},{"location":"content-requirements/#content-requirements-and-best-practices","text":"Here are requirements and best practices to keep in mind as you create and enter content for OSU Extension.

Try to use nouns whenever possible (instead of adjectives or verbs), for example, \u201csustainability\u201d instead of \u201csustainable.\u201d Only use one \u201cform\u201d of each keyword. For example, don\u2019t tag a piece of content with both \u201capple\u201d and \u201capples.\u201d Don\u2019t repeat information in other fields. For example, if you have tagged content with the region \u201cCentral Oregon,\u201d you don\u2019t need to add it as a keyword. Avoid acronyms. Use keywords that could apply to more than one piece of content. Each keyword should contain a single idea. For example, instead of \u201ctrees and shrubs,\u201d use the separate keywords \u201ctrees\u201d and \u201cshrubs.\u201d","title":"Keyword"},{"location":"content-requirements/#region","text":"The region tag can narrow content down to only what is relevant for someone in a particular geographical area.

Your groups determine what content you can enter and edit in the Extension website. Options on Where to Put the Content All content that is going to be included in Extension\u2019s digital strategy going forward must be entered in the Extension website. This includes most, but not all, of Extension\u2019s existing web content. However, the Extension website is not a good place for: Extension faculty and staff resources Historical documents or reference materials. Use Box or archive as appropriate. Content that needs work. Content should conform to the website\u2019s guiding principles, described in the introduction to this guide. Before adding content to the new site, review and/or revise to ensure accuracy. Revise or redesign to ensure it is on brand. Volunteer resources. A separate website solution is being discussed. For now, a combination of the Extension website and Box is a likely solution. When your team is ready to add volunteer content, please let us know. Together, we can decide on the best short-term solution.

OSU WordPress Blog Content that isn\u2019t for a broad number of external visitors Anything that should be included in the digital strategy going forward; content for a general external audience Scholars Archive Historical documents and research Extension Communications is responsible for archiving Extension catalog publications. Library Archive Websites that are historical (no longer maintained) Your Groups Your groups assigned in the website determine what content you are allowed to edit. When someone in your a group creates a piece of content, you and anyone in that group can edit it. When you are a member of a group, the type of group determines what type of content you can add. There are four types of groups on the site. Content Team Program Team County Office Team Topic Committee (representatives from different content teams) A person may be a member of several groups with different group types, so it is important to understand what content belongs in what group. Types of groups and how they overlap. Content Teams Content teams are responsible for entering educational content, including region specific content . They can also add events and newsletters if not already added by another team. Content entered by Content Teams primarily displays on topic pages on the Extension website (e.g. the Dairy topic page). A single content team may enter content for multiple topics. Likewise, a single topic page may show content entered by multiple groups. Extension catalog publications are already added to the Extension website by Extension Communications so you don\u2019t have to do this. Program Groups Program groups are responsible for entering materials that visitors need to join or participate in their program (e.g. Master Woodland Managers) . On the Extension website, they can also feature educational content entered by a Content Team that is especially relevant to members of their program or point people to the relevant topic pages. Program groups do not represent the seven Extension program areas, institutes, centers, nor industry/discipline programs. They are ways for the public to get involved in programming like Master Beekeeper or Walk with Ease. For most programs, a single statewide group enters content (e.g. Better Bones and Balance). However, programs that differ significantly by county may have a separate group for each of their local programs (e.g. Benton County 4-H). This also requires having enough county-based staff to support content maintenance. Program teams will enter most of their content as \u201cprogram resources\u201d. Each of these represents an individual form, file, or link. They can organize these on \u201csubpages\u201d on the Extension website. Program groups can also enter events, newsletters, and announcements that are of interest to members of their program. County Office Groups County office groups are responsible for entering content about their office\u2019s physical location and services provided, highlighting the activities going on at the office, and directing visitors to relevant educational and program content . This also includes the combined stations. County office groups can create events, announcements and newsletters. They can also set up local focus areas on the Extension website. These serve as a link between the county and a topic or program that is of particular interest to visitors from that county. For example, a county on the coast could describe their work with coastal issues and link to educational content about marine wildlife. Combined stations may also link to the corresponding Agricultural Experiment Station research pages on the College of Agricultural Sciences website. Topic Committees Topic Committees are responsible for deciding what content to feature on the topic page they are in charge of (e.g. Beef Cattle). This may involve: identifying the various audiences the topic is aimed at and their questions highlighting high quality, important, or seasonally relevant content for that topic setting up keyword standards for content in that topic establishing a content schedule for the topic page content They may also write some text for topic pages that describes Extension\u2019s work in a particular area. As a committee, they do not enter pieces of content themselves. Most members of topic committees will also be members of a content team. However, it is not necessary to be on a content team (or any other group) to be on a topic committee. Case Study: Groups for a Master Gardener Coordinator Say that in county X, there is a single person that acts as a Master Gardener volunteer coordinator. This employee develops educational materials as well as forms and other materials for volunteers. This person would be a member of (at least) two groups. The \u201cHome Horticulture\u201d content team: They would use this group to enter their educational gardening content, since gardening information is relevant to people outside the program too, not just participants. The \u201cMaster Gardener \u2013 X County\u201d program team: They would use this group to enter the program materials for Master Gardeners in their county. They could also display educational content that their volunteers would find useful. Roles and Responsibilities It is helpful to know not only your website groups, but the roles of all people involved in OSU Extension's digital strategy. This can show you where to get support. Current responsibilities have focused on the Extension website, although it is just one piece of the long-term plans. Everyone in Extension Engage with and contribute to at least one content team, program group, or office group. Ensure your profile on the website is up to date, including a headshot photo and expertise. Provide requested information to begin development of the customer relationship management system. Program Area Leaders and Regional Directors Establish process and calendar for creation/management of content. Help the Navigator team establish metrics necessary to maintain progress and align with current OSU Strategic Plan. Work with the content strategist to establish governance plans. Ensure supervised faculty are engaged and actively participating in at least one website group. Begin planning for use of a customer relationship management system to meet specific program goals. Team Leader or Group Coordinator Establish team or group role assignments. Review website changes, content updates, and new features as they are rolled out and communicate to team or group members. Establish a content plan with the support of the content strategist. Coordinate who will do entry in the team or group and establish a process. Ensure faculty and staff on related Extension website pages are up to date. Team or Group Members Contribute to your team's content plan or group's assignments. Add relevant content to the website; fill in gaps. Increase findability of content by entering, monitoring, and revising tags. Improve readability and review accuracy of existing content. Learn more about these Primary Roles and Responsibilities The executive leadership and communication and technology units also have a role to play. Their responsibilities look at project management, resource alignment, communication and training, systems development and integration, and other strategic planning roles. Learn more about the Other Roles and Responsibilities for Leadership and Support Content Types As mentioned in the introduction to this guide, it is important that content have structure for Extension\u2019s digital strategy to work. A content type is how we structure a piece of content. Examples on the Extension website are articles, events, newsletters, and videos. Each content type has different fields to fill out when entering it. The content types that you are able to use depend on the group type you are using. Web Groups Content Teams Program Groups MG & 4-H County Program Groups County Offices Announcement County and program news items or announcements x x x Article Text and image-based educational content x Collection Manually selected groups of educational content x Educational Document General-interest educational material uploaded as a document x Educational Gallery Content based around collections of images (e.g. plant profiles) x Event Workshops, classes, event information for external audience x x x x Local Focus Area Description of work done in a county in a particular topic or program x Newsletter Issue Print, electronic, web-based newsletters x x x x Online Resource Link to educational material located on another website x Podcast Episode Audio that is part of a series or podcast x Program Resource Materials needed to join or participate in a program.

May also group or link to educational content relevant to a specific audience x x Video An informational video x Shared Content Types These content types can be added by a number of group types. Announcement : a time-sensitive piece of information Event : an event that people can attend Newsletter Issue : a newsletter. This can also include content that comes out sequentially and that we would like to keep a record of, such as pest alerts or research updates. Social Media Link : a link to a social media account for an Extension program or county office. Content Team Content Types Article : text-based educational content Collection : a group of other pieces of content of any content type Educational Document : a file (such as a PDF or Excel spreadsheet) containing educational content that cannot be entered as an article, including calculators, diagrams, or other content that depends on images or formatting Educational Gallery : content based around collections of images (e.g. plant profiles) Podcast Episode : audio that is part of a podcast or other series Project : information about a partnership, project, or activity done by Extension Online Resource : a link to an external website containing educational content Video : an educational video Program Team Content Types Program : Represents an externally facing Extension program that members of the public can participate in. (See the Adding and Editing Content - Program section for more information about what a \u201cprogram\u201d is.) Program Resource : A file or link to a resource needed for visitors to join or participate in a program. Subpage : A page to organize program resources and supply supplementary text, images, and videos. County Office Team Content Types County office : Represents an Extension presence in a county. Local focus area : Information about work or activities done in a county that relate to a program or topic. Review of Terms Group : membership gives access to edit the group\u2019s content. Content type : a template for content with a defined structure that consists of several fields. For example, article, video, program resource, and newsletter. Key Takeaways Your group(s) determine(s) which content you are allowed to edit. Content is added to the website as one of several available content types depending on what it is.

Clicking this button will open a new window called the image/document/audio/video browser (depending on what you are uploading). Image browser. The browser consists of two tabs: Upload new : This is where you can upload a new file. After selecting the file from your computer (or entering an audio or video embed URL), you will need to enter some additional information. Image : There are a number of fields you can fill out for an image. Alternative text : If there is text in the image, re-enter it here so that assistive technology and search engines can read it. See Captions and Alternative Text for more information. Name : The name of the image is not seen by the public, but should be descriptive so the image can be found for reuse later if needed. Keywords : Enter keywords about the subject (e.g. \"farm\", \"horse\", \"children\") and style (e.g. \"portrait\", \"landscape\") of the image to make it easier to find for reuse later. Caption : Enter any additional information about the image that is useful to visitors here (not in the Alternative text field). Keep in mind that this photo may be reused for other purposes in the future. Photo credit and photo credit link Don\u2019t allow reuse : This prevents others from using the image in other places. Use this if there is limited permissions to use the image. If the photo can be reused, consider making the file name descriptive so it\u2019s easier to search for in the future. Document : Provide a document name. This may be seen by the public, so use something that makes sense. Audio : Name : A name for the audio embed. This is not seen by the public. Transcript : A transcript for the audio. This is legally required for accessibility and also helps search engines find relevant content more effectively. If you cannot provide a transcript when initially publishing audio, include the contact information of the person to contact if someone would like to request the transcript. Video : Provide a video name. This is not seen by the public. Reuse existing : If you or someone else has already uploaded the file you want to use, you can reuse it without having to re-enter the information. Search by the filename of the existing item or the name it was given when originally uploaded. When you find it, click the checkbox next to it. Then click the \u201cSelect\u201d button at the bottom of the window. Save the page for the selection to take effect. Image Requirements and Best Practices Dimensions and File Size On the Extension website, there are three kinds of images that you might upload. Full-width images : images that span the entire width of the page. These include \u201chero images\u201d at the top of pages and backgrounds behind text on subpages. There are several things to keep in mind when you select these images in order for them to be effective. Use images that are horizontally oriented (called \u201clandscape\u201d). Use large enough image dimensions. They should be at least 2000px wide . Hero images should be about 325px tall, and text background images should be tall enough to be a backdrop to all the text you enter . When creating text with background sections, remember that for some people text on busy backgrounds is difficult to read. Text in these sections have a semi-transparent white background, but it is still a good idea to select images that are light and not too busy. Content images : images that appear with educational content such as articles. These can be any orientation, but should be at least 400px wide . When a visitor clicks on one of these, a full-sized version will show. Other images : images added manually to subpages and projects. These can be any size you want. When a visitor clicks on one of these, a full-sized version will show. If you know how to set the resolution, 300 pixels/inch is preferred. The Extension website automatically attempts to optimize images when you upload them. But it is still important to use as small a file size as possible while maintaining image quality. All image uploads are limited to 10MB . Where to Get Images It is extremely important that you only upload images to the Extension website that you have permission to use . This means you cannot use images from Google, another website, or a publication unless you get permission. You must also specify the image credit for any image you upload. By default, other people adding content on the site are able to reuse images you upload. To prevent this , check the \u201cDon\u2019t allow reuse of this image\u201d box when uploading the image. Be cautious of a free image site's terms and usage policies. Here are some good sources of free legal images to use: Extension Communications Photo Archive OSU Brand Photos Creative Commons Search (Includes Flickr and other sources of images; check licensing status and attribution information.) Have a great opportunity to capture a diversity of people involved in our Extension work? Let Extension Communications know, and we may be able to send a professional photographer. If you are using a photo that your office or program took, you must have a completed model release for photos that have people in them. Download the forms in Box . Captions and Alternative Text When you upload an image, you can add \u201calternative text\u201d ( alt text ) and a caption. The caption displays below the image with information about the subject of the image. If you plan to reuse the photo in many different situations, then leave out a caption or make it more general. The alt text is a replacement for the image when the image is not available. This happens, for example, when a person is using assistive technology or has images turned off. It is also visible to search engines that scan the site for relevant content to show in search results. Alt text is usually only necessary when there is text in the image. In this case you should re-enter that text in the alt text field as it appears in the image. You should also include alt text when the image illustrates something that isn\u2019t explained in the caption or other surrounding text. Quick Tip : For more details on when and how to craft an alternative text description, see: WebAIM: Alternative Text Guide . File Management When you have a document, such as a PDF, that you want to add to the Extension website, there are several options. Option A: Website-Based Content Website-based content can be read directly on a website. This is opposed to files that someone has to download and open to read. On the Extension website, website-based content includes articles, subpages, and other text content. This type of content has several advantages over uploading documents. It makes content: more likely to be found and ranked highly in a search easier to use on mobile devices easier to use for people who use assistive technology such as screen readers easier to change without breaking existing links or leaving old versions available automatically remain visually \u201con brand\u201d if the site design changes in the future Therefore, we strongly recommend adding materials as web content whenever possible . To do this, copy and paste or type the contents of a document into a text box. Good options are an article or subpage. There are some situations when a document cannot or should not be added to the site as website-based content. These include: forms that people need to fill out (though you may want to consider implementing these in Qualtrics ) PowerPoint presentations documents that contain complex graphics, tables, or diagrams documents that need to be private or restricted to a certain group of people Option B: Box We highly recommend using OSU Box for files that you will need to change or replace regularly . Box has a very robust versioning system for files. This allows you to easily replace files with new versions without breaking existing links. It is also the only option currently available for files that need to be password-protected . Here is how you can upload files to Box and use them on the Extension website: Step 1: Upload File to Box Log in to Box with your ONID credentials. If needed, create a folder for your content by clicking the \u201cNew\u201d button in the top right of the screen and selecting \u201cFolder.\u201d Give the folder a name and click on it to see its contents. Click the \u201cUpload\u201d button in the top right corner, select \u201cFiles,\u201d and select the files you want to upload from your computer. Replace a File with a New Version Hover over the file in the list of files and click the \u201c...\u201d icon to the far right. Select \u201cUpload new version.\u201d The new file does NOT need to have the same name as the old file. Existing links will continue to work either way. Step 2: Get the Link for the File Hover over the file (or folder*) you want to link to in the list of files and click the \u201cShare\u201d button on the far right. *If you follow these steps on a folder instead of a file, the link will take visitors to a listing where they can download any file in that folder. In the window that pops up, click on the blue arrow next to \u201cPeople in your company\u201d and select \u201cPeople with the link\u201d instead. The result should look like this: If you want to protect the file with a password, click the \"Link Settings\" link in the the popup in #2 above. Check the box next to \u201cRequire password\u201d (below), enter the password you want people to use. To provide a direct link to download the file (doesn't take user to Box), check the box next to \u201cAllow Download\u201d. Click \"Copy\" to save the URL to your clipboard, then click \"Save\". Quick Tip : Visit the OSU Box website OSU Box website for complete documentation. Step 3: Add a Link to the Extension Site There are several ways to add a link, depending on the type of content your group can add. Create an online resource for the link. Create a program resource for the link. Create a newsletter issue and select \u201cLink\u201d for the type. Add the link to a text box of a subpage, announcement, or article. This step is also applicable to documents hosted elsewhere, such as on a college site, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Option C: Upload to the Extension Site Available Content Types Documents can be added to the website as any of the following content types. Educational Document (content teams) Event (anyone) Newsletter Issue (anyone) Program Resource (program teams) Removing and Replacing Documents Files that are attached to a piece of content will be deleted when you remove the file from the content and save or you delete the content. Deleted files will no longer be accessible. If you want to maintain a copy of the old file, you must do this yourself beforehand. When a document is deleted, all links in teasers for the content on the Extension website will update automatically. This includes links that are created when you add page sections such as featured content or program resource lists to subpages. However, if someone manually created a link to it (for example, in a text box on a subpage), that link will break. Summary Flow Chart Review of Terms Alt text : text that is used as a replacement for the image when it is not available (e.g. when a visitor is using a screen reader or when the site is being scanned by Google).

The alt text is a replacement for the image when the image is not available. This happens, for example, when a person is using assistive technology or has images turned off. It is also visible to search engines that scan the site for relevant content to show in search results. Alt text is usually only necessary when there is text in the image.

It has become obvious that there is no one best way to reach Extension\u2019s audiences. Today, people get information from social media, smartphone apps, Google searches, smart home devices, and more. In the future, these channels will vary even more widely. We can be certain that as technology develops, the ways people use it will constantly change. If Extension hopes to engage a wide audience and remain relevant, it needs digital content that is flexible and adaptive to these changes. Oregon State University Extension has developed a digital strategy to meet this need. This project aligns with similar initiatives in other colleges and organizations within OSU as well as the University itself. The University\u2019s Strategic Plan 4.0 includes goals such as: \u201c[deliver] distinctive and affordable education via multiple pathways\u201d, \u201cretool the OSU experience for the 21st century learner\u201d, \u201ccoordinate marketing and communications across onsite, digital, and hybrid learning platforms\u201d, and \u201cintegrate and simplify technology systems, data practices and policies to increase our organizational agility.\u201d All of these goals align with Extension\u2019s new digital strategy. Extension\u2019s digital strategy consists of two high-level objectives: Create a central \u201ccontent management system\u201d (CMS) for digital content that can provide a variety of feeds to devices and platforms. Implement a \u201ccustomer relationship management\u201d (CRM) system to deliver content in a personalized way. Content Management System The traditional way digital content is served vs. Extension\u2019s new digital strategy. A content management system (or CMS) is a system that works like a database for content. Currently, we populate our CMS by entering content into the new Extension website. A CMS contains the content itself as well as information about the content such as its author and what it\u2019s about. It can then feed the content to many different \"channels,\u201d including websites, social media feeds, smartphone apps, and smart home devices. The goal behind a central CMS is to meet people where they are instead of trying to force them to come to us. To create a CMS that can fulfill this goal, our way of thinking about the content we enter needs to change. In particular, content in the new system needs to have the following characteristics: Centralized : All content delivered by the CMS needs to be entered and stored in one place. Structured : For diverse platforms to be able to parse content in useful ways, the content needs to have structure. Instead of putting a bunch of content in one text box on a page, it is better to organize that data into fields. Atomic : \"Atomic\" means \u201cof or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.\u201d This means that we want to enter content in the system as the smallest possible (and sensible) pieces. Then the system can put them back together in different ways depending on the context. Described : Computers are getting \u201csmarter\u201d all the time, but they always do better with a little human help. Authors should include information about the content in the system. This gives clues as to what the content is about, who it is for, and when it is appropriate to present. Case Study: Home Food Safety and Preservation Program Publications On the previous Extension website, this program created a page for its publications. Each publication is a PDF file containing information about a food preservation topic, and each PDF was a link on the page. Instead of adding them all to the CMS as one long page of links like on the old site, content managers for the program entered each publication separately. Now the website can list them all together for volunteers and present them separately to visitors interested in a specific subject. Also, if authors need to update information, then they just need to change the publication once. It will be updated everywhere it shows on the site, which avoids broken links and reduces workload. Customer Relationship Management The next phase of the digital strategy initiative will be to develop a customer relationship management (or CRM) system. A CRM system allows an organization to record a person\u2019s interactions with them. In Extension\u2019s case, this may include event registrations, newsletter subscriptions, financial contributions, and content viewed on our website. A CRM system will allow us to interact with web-based learners and clients in a more constructive way. Previously, Extension presented content to visitors with little opportunity for conversation, feedback, or follow-up. Our new digital strategy will give Extension educators opportunities to build relationships through the web. Extension will use Salesforce to be compatible with other groups across the university using it. This project is still in the early stages, but at this time, our priorities are to: work with a Salesforce programmer to develop and implement the software; provide a personalized digital experience to our clients that is relevant to their needs and interests and timely and accessible; meet high standards of security and privacy; and ensure that our clients are comfortable with their experience. The Extension Website The Extension website that the public and our participants see is just one way people will get content from Extension. Content entered into the website populates Extension\u2019s CMS. This will eventually also feed information out through social media, emails, and other technology. The Extension website was created in order to update our web platform according to the University\u2019s policies. To follow the new digital strategy, the site was built with several guiding principles in mind. Customer focused . The new website follows known customer preferences and bases menus and navigation on what customers want to do, learn, or search for, not on an internal topic or label. Mobile friendly . The new website employs layouts and content that can be delivered in mobile-friendly ways. Data informed . We use analytics and other data (e.g., needs assessments, trends) to support decisions. Relevant . The site is built so content can be easily updated frequently. It implements processes that create less work for people, are easier with appropriate training, and are managed at the right level. Content focused . It's about the content, not about the sites. The goal is to integrate or transition relevant content into the CMS rather than develop, host, or manage individual sites. Practical . The new website allows faculty and staff to focus on content rather than website design, development, and management. The right people are doing the right things. The Extension website is a living project that we work hard to continuously improve. Since launch in June 2018, we have been collecting data and feedback and implementing improvements and new functionality. Review of Terms Content Management System (CMS): a centralized source of content that feeds data to a variety of platforms, including the Extension website Fields : individual pieces of data that make up content. For example, a person\u2019s faculty/staff profile would contain separate fields for their name, phone number, email address, etc. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System : a system that records the interaction between an individual and an organization, and maintains a database of contacts. It connects with the CMS and other tools to get relevant information to audiences. Extension website : the first of what will be many facets of Extension\u2019s digital strategy. The content going into the Extension website will, in the future, also appear in other places (e.g. social media, email). This will be possible due to the way the content is entered and the existence of a content management system. Key Takeaways Extension\u2019s digital strategy will make our content available to clients that access information online in a variety of ways. Content entered into the Extension Website goes into a \u201ccontent management system\u201d that will feed into many channels. In order for this to be effective, content needs to be structured, atomic, and described. The next phase in the digital strategy initiative will be to implement a \u201cCustomer Relationship Management\u201d system.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"intro/#extensions-digital-strategy","text":"The ways people seek and use information online are more diverse than ever.

Team"},{"location":"managing-content/","text":"Managing Content Content needs management and maintenance after it has been added to the site in order to be effective. Content Drafting, Reviewing, Publishing, Archiving, and Deleting In certain cases, you may want your content to be invisible to visitors. Most content entered into any website will eventually become out of date. Or you might want to review the content you entered before it gets published. Content that is visible to public visitors is published and content that is not is unpublished . For most content types, there are three ways to be unpublished: Draft : The content needs to be finished or reviewed before it gets published. In Review : The content was published, but has been taken down for review. Archived : The content was published, but is now out of date or no longer needed. Note that when you are viewing a piece of content that is unpublished (not visible to the public) it will have a pink background. At the bottom of any edit screen, you can use the dropdown to select \u201cdraft,\u201d \u201cin review.\u201d or \u201carchived.\u201d New Drafts of Published Content If you update a piece of published content and set its state to \u201cDraft,\u201d the previous version of that content will remain visible. To hide all previous versions, set the state to \u201cIn Review\u201d or \u201cArchived\u201d instead. The edit screen for a piece of content will always contain the content from the latest draft. However, you can view both the latest draft and the currently published version. To see the currently published version that is visible to the public, click on the content\u2019s title on the Group Content page. You can also click the \u201cView\u201d tab at the top of the content\u2019s edit screen. To see the latest draft of the content, click on the \u201cLatest version\u201d tab at the top of the content\u2019s edit screen. These tabs are also visible below the title on the content\u2019s page. At the top of the \u201cLatest version,\u201d you will see a control where you can publish the content and make the changes visible to the public: If you want to discard the draft and edit the currently published version of the content, you can \u201crevert\u201d to that revision of the content. See below for more details. Viewing Previous Versions of Content Making changes to a piece of content and saving it creates a new revision . If needed, you can look at all the previous revisions of a piece of content or revert content to a previous revision. When you save a piece of content, you can enter a \u201cRevision log message\u201d to describe the changes you made or why you made them. You and other members of your group can see these messages later. To view the revisions for a piece of content, go to the edit screen for the piece of content. At the top of the page are several tabs, including a \u201cRevisions\u201d tab. When you click on this tab, you will see a list of all revisions for the content. The revision that is currently visible to visitors is highlighted in yellow and says \u201cCurrent revision.\u201d From this page, you can do several things: View a previous revision : Click on the date of the revision you want to view. Compare two revisions : Select the two revisions and click the \u201cCompare Revisions\u201d button at the bottom of the page. This will show you the differences between the two revisions by highlighting text that has been added, removed, or changed. Revert to a previous revision : Click the \u201cRevert\u201d button for the revision you want to revert to. This makes the selected revision the \u201ccurrent\u201d revision. If needed, you can re-revert to the revision you were at originally with the same process. Deleting Content Deleting content will remove it and all of its previous versions from the site permanently. It is better to \u201carchive\u201d content rather than delete; you can still find it on the Group Content page when logged in if you want to update it and republish. It also helps avoid the content being inadvertently added again, since the reason it was \u201carchived\u201d can be noted in the revisions field for future reference. Next to the Save button on an edit page you will also see the \u201cdelete\u201d link. It is also an option in the drop down next to the content\u2019s Edit button on the Group Content page.

If you want to maintain a copy of the old content, you must copy and save this yourself beforehand. Extension Communications Copyediting The Extension Communications pubs team will copyedit articles entered on the Extension website. This is done after an article is published by a content team. When the pubs team makes edits, a new draft of the content is created, so the original remains visible to the public and doesn't change. The person marked as the \"Group contact\" for the group will get an email whenever a piece of content is copyedited. This will include a link where they can view the copyedited draft and approve the changes. You can also view a list of copyedited content that needs to be approved by going to the group content page for that group and clicking the \"Copyedits\" tab at the top of the page. This page lists all content in the group that has been copyedited and needs approval. You can search for content by the uploader or original title. If the title was changed during copyediting, you will see the change when you click on the content. You can view the copyedited draft by clicking on the title of the content. This page also lists the Extension Communications pubs team member who copyedited the content. If you have questions about the changes that were made, click on their user name to go to their contact form. When you view the draft for a copyedited piece of content, you can approve it using the moderation controls at the top of the content. Set the dropdown to \"copyedited and published\" and click the \"Apply\" button. You can also make edits to the copyedited content before making it public by clicking the \"Edit\" tab and editing as normal. You can find more details about the changes made by going to the \"Revisions\" tab on the content page. This allows you to see notes left by the copyeditor and to compare the copyedited version to the previous version. See the previous section for more information about the revisions tab. Displaying and Organizing Content on Other Pages In some cases, you might want content that exists on the site to show up on a specific page. The way to do this depends on where you want the content to show up, who added it, and what kind of content it is. Generally, this will involve adding a tag to a piece of content or adding a page section to a page . Content on Topic Pages You or a member of your group added the content Someone else added the content Educational content Edit the content and add a tag for the topic in Step 2 of the edit screen . If you want the content to show on the topic landing page, a member of the topic committee will need to select it in a \u201c featured topic section .\u201d Select the content in a \u201c featured topic section \u201d on the landing page. You will need to be a member of the topic committee for that topic. Or Members of topic committees can modify the tags of the content and add a tag for the topic. (See below.) Events & Announcements Edit the content and add a tag for the topic in Step 2 on the Edit screen . Members of topic committees can modify the tags of the content and add a tag for the topic. (See below.) People (\u201cExperts\u201d) Edit your profile and add the topic as your \u201cExpertise\u201d Or Topic committees may select up to four people to display on the landing page, whether or not they have the topic as an expertise. Content on Program Pages You or a member of your group added the content Someone else added the content Educational content N/A - Educational content is not entered through a program group. Contact the person who entered the content and ask them to add a tag for the program and any appropriate keywords. See Working with Other Content Authors for more information. Then, add a \u201c Program Tagged Content \u201d section to the program page where you want the content to display. You can select a keyword to only display content tagged with that keyword in a particular page section. Or Add a \u201c featured content \u201d section to the page and select the content. Remember that it is better to direct people to topic pages, which are always getting updates, than to try to list all relevant content on a program page. Program resources* Add a \u201c Program resource list \u201d section to the page where you want the content to show. You will probably need to select a \u201cCategory to display\u201d so you can narrow this section down to specific items. Then edit the program resource and tag it with the category you specified. Local programs can display program resources from their statewide parent by adding a \u201c Program statewide resource list \u201d section to a page. You can narrow the list down by selecting a \u201ccategory to display\u201d configured by the statewide program. Events & Announcements Enter the content through the program\u2019s group Or Edit the content and add a tag for the program.

Modify the tags of the content and add a tag for the program. Someone associated with the program will need to add a \u201c Program events list \u201d section to the page where you want the content to show. People Submit a web support request to have a person added to the directory for a program. *Please remember: Do not add educational content as a program resource. Program resources are for materials such as handbooks or forms that are only of interest to participants in a program. Once content has been added to county or program pages, the sidebar where the pages are listed can be reordered, nested, or both (i.e., housed beneath a broader subpage). See Adding and Editing Content: Subpage for more information. Restricting Tagging of Your Program If needed, you can set up your program so that only members of the program\u2019s group can tag educational content with it. This means that only members of the program group would be able to make educational content appear on the program\u2019s pages. To do this, you need to have the role \u201cMember & Setting Manager\u201d in the program\u2019s group. Go to the Group Content page for the group and click the \u201cSettings\u201d tab at the top. This will take you to a page where you can manage the group\u2019s settings. To restrict tagging to the program, check the \u201cRestrict Tagging\u201d box and then save. Content on County Pages/Focus Areas You or a member of your group added the content Someone else added the content Educational content N/A - Educational content is not entered through a county group. Add a \u201c custom content list \u201d or \" highlighted content item \" section to the page and select the content. Remember that it is better to direct people to topic pages, which are always getting updates, than to try to list all relevant content on a county page. Events & Announcements Enter the content through the county\u2019s group Or Edit the content and add a tag for the county . Someone associated with the county will need to add a \u201c County events list \u201d section to the page where you want the content to show. You may need to select a topic or \u201cCalendar to display\u201d so you can narrow this section down to specific terms. Modify the tags of the content and add a tag for the county, and if needed, select a specific calendar. Someone associated with the county will need to add a \u201c County events list section to the page where you want the content to show. You may need to select a \u201cCalendar to display\u201d so you can narrow this section down to specific terms. People Submit a web support request to have a person added to the directory for a county. Case Study - Master Gardener Program Pages Other Ways to Group Content Before putting in the effort to group content on a county or program page or Collection, check if the site can dynamically group the content for you. Several pages on the site have filters in the sidebar that can group content automatically based on tags. You can link people to these pages with filters already applied. To do this, go to the page and apply the filters you want. Then, copy the URL in the address bar of your web browser and use it to create a link. Some Examples: Central Oregon vegetable gardening resources (filtered topic page) Resources about lambing (filtered topic page) Nursery and greenhouse resources in Spanish (filtered topic page) Programs for people interested in forest health and management (filtered programs page) Spotted wing drosophila videos (filtered search results page) Modifying Content Tags Many pages on the Extension website pull in content to display based on \"tags\" on that content. For example, county event pages show both events entered by the county group and events tagged with the county. This may cause issues when a piece of content is tagged incorrectly: an event may be tagged for a county where it isn't relevant, or an event that is relevant to a county may not be tagged with that county. In these cases, you can modify the tags of content even when you are not a member of the group that entered it. To do this, there are two options: - Go to the page for the content and click the \"Modify Tags\" tab at the top. This is in the location where you would normally see an \"Edit\" tab if you had access to edit the content. - While viewing a teaser for the content, hover over it with your mouse. This will reveal a pencil icon in the top right corner of the teaser. When you click the pencil icon, you will see the option to \"Modify Tags\". In either case, clicking \"Modify Tags\" will take you to a restricted edit screen where you can add and remove tags for the content without otherwise editing it. Note: Catalog publications are imported to the Extension website with tags from the catalog, so their tags cannot be modified through the website. If tags on a publication need to change, please submit a web support request . Content feedback and analytics For Extension\u2019s digital strategy to be successful, we need to use data from visitors to decide how to create, maintain, and distribute content. There are features on the Extension website for content authors to find analytics and visitor feedback for their content. Visitor feedback There are a few features on the Extension website that collect qualitative data. This type of data answers questions about content that can help improve its quality, such as: Did visitors find the information they were looking for? What did they do most often on the page? Were they able to understand the content? How feedback is collected The first feature is a feedback widget on the right-hand side of every page: When a visitor clicks on the widget, a small window comes up asking them \u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d They then score a page on a scale of 1-5 (represented by smiley faces). After they score the page, they have the opportunity to leave a comment. They may also enter their email address if they would like a response to the comment. Another way of collecting visitor feedback is a poll . With a poll, we can ask more specific customized questions. For example, we have a poll set up on all 4-H pages that asks what is missing from the page. With this data, we wanted to improve visitors' experience during future fair seasons. This window pops up from the bottom of the page after a visitor has had a chance to look around for several seconds. When they comment, they also have the option to leave their email address if they would like a response. Finally, at the bottom of most pages, visitors see a small form asking \u201cWas this page helpful?\u201d They can select \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d and have an option to leave a (non-public) comment. Finding feedback on your content To view feedback for a piece of content, go to the content and click the \u201cFeedback\u201d tab under the content\u2019s title. It is near the \u201cEdit\u201d tab. To see an overview of feedback scores for all content in a group, go to that group\u2019s group content page. Then click the \u201cFeedback\u201d tab under the group name. This will take you to a list of all content with feedback in the group. To see the comments left for a particular piece of content, you can click on \u201cDetails\u201d in its row on this page. Group analytics dashboard There is an \u201cAnalytics\u201d tab at the top of the group content page for each group. Clicking on this tab will take you to the analytics dashboard for the content in that group. On the top of the dashboard, there is a link to \u201cSee analytics for all of Extension.\u201d This expands the data on the dashboard to include all content on the Extension website. That way, you can see how your content compares. Data available on the dashboard The dashboard is broken up into several sections: Top content : this section contains information about How often content from the group is viewed (pageviews) How many people visit the group\u2019s content (users) How long on average that people spend viewing the content The most visited pages in the group How visitors find us : this section contains information about\\ The way that visitors find content produced by the group (see the help text on the right-hand side of the dashboard for definitions) Websites, both internal and external to OSU, that link to the group\u2019s content About the visitors : this section contains information about The approximate locations of visitors who view content from the group The preferred languages of visitors to the group\u2019s content The types of devices used by visitors to access the content How many times visitors visit content in the group Visitor navigation : you will see this section if you are a member of a program group. It shows information about the first and last pages visitors go to when they visit the group pages. What visitors look for : this section is only on the dashboard for all content on the Extension website. It has information about the most common terms visitors enter in the search box on the website. It also shows the most common terms people enter that return no results. How to use the dashboard controls There are several controls on the dashboard you can use to expand or restrict the data you see. Date range: this dropdown widget is at the top of the dashboard. You can use it to select the date range for the data shown on the dashboard. Page title: in the \u201cTop Content\u201d section, there is a widget you can use to see data about only a specific page or set of pages. To do this, type in the title of the page and press enter. If you don\u2019t know the exact name of the page, you can click on the box that says \u201cEQUALS\u201d. This will reveal a dropdown where you can select \u201cCONTAINS\u201d instead. Search terms: in the \u201cWhat visitors look for\u201d section, you can filter to see if the search terms contain a particular word. To do this: Click on \u201cEQUALS\u201d to reveal a dropdown and select \u201cCONTAINS\u201d Type in the word you want to filter by and press enter How to interpret the data The content analytics dashboard provides quantitative data about content. This means that you will need to interpret it to find actionable takeaways. Here are some tips for doing this: Identify gaps and opportunities. The \u201cAbout the Visitors\u201d section may show you audiences that you may not be effectively serving up to this point. Do you have content relevant to the places they are from? Do you have content in the language(s) they prefer? On the flip side, this section may reveal that audiences you have heavily focused on in the past are not using your content as often as you would like. If this is the case, you may need to do some outreach to figure out why this is or reconsider where you are directing your efforts. In the \u201cHow visitors find us\u201d section, look at the sites that are linking to your content. Is your content appropriate for people coming from those sites? Are there any sites you know of that you would like to link to you? The \u201cWhat visitors look for\u201d section may identify topics visitors are interested in that your group has expertise in. Look for trends and outliers. In the \u201cTop content\u201d section, look for pages that are more popular than others or pages where people spend more time than average. Then, you can see what about that content could help to bring the rest of your content up to that level. One way to do this for pages is to look at the feedback on the page. Also look at the pageviews over time graph at the top of the dashboard for times when pageviews spiked. Do you know why the spike happened? Can you make that happen again? If you don\u2019t know where a spike in pageviews came from, try narrowing the date range for the dashboard to only that day and look at the \u201cWhere visitors come from\u201d section. Review of Terms Published : content that is visible to visitors to the site Unpublished : content that is hidden to visitors to the site. It is only visible to the uploader and other members of the group it belongs to. Draft : content that is unfinished or needs work before being published In Review : content that was published but has been taken down for review Archived : content that was published but has been taken down because it is no longer accurate or relevant Revision : a version of a piece of content that shows what was modified and saved Key Takeaways Content that is published is visible to visitors to the site and content that is unpublished is not. Content that is unpublished may be a \u201cdraft,\u201d \u201cin review,\u201d or \u201carchived.\u201d You are generally able to place content on another page by tagging the content, adding a section to the page, or both. The website is often able to automatically group related content based on tags. Content authors can see comments visitors have left on content by clicking on the \"Feedback\" tab when viewing the content. Group members can access an analytics dashboard for their group's content by clicking the \"Analytics\" tab on the group content page.","title":"Managing Content"},{"location":"managing-content/#managing-content","text":"Content needs management and maintenance after it has been added to the site in order to be effective.","title":"Managing Content"},{"location":"managing-content/#content-drafting-reviewing-publishing-archiving-and-deleting","text":"In certain cases, you may want your content to be invisible to visitors.

After they score the page, they have the opportunity to leave a comment. They may also enter their email address if they would like a response to the comment. Another way of collecting visitor feedback is a poll . With a poll, we can ask more specific customized questions. For example, we have a poll set up on all 4-H pages that asks what is missing from the page. With this data, we wanted to improve visitors' experience during future fair seasons. This window pops up from the bottom of the page after a visitor has had a chance to look around for several seconds. When they comment, they also have the option to leave their email address if they would like a response. Finally, at the bottom of most pages, visitors see a small form asking \u201cWas this page helpful?\u201d They can select \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d and have an option to leave a (non-public) comment.","title":"How feedback is collected"},{"location":"managing-content/#finding-feedback-on-your-content","text":"To view feedback for a piece of content, go to the content and click the \u201cFeedback\u201d tab under the content\u2019s title.

Do you have content in the language(s) they prefer?

If this is the case, you may need to do some outreach to figure out why this is or reconsider where you are directing your efforts. In the \u201cHow visitors find us\u201d section, look at the sites that are linking to your content. Is your content appropriate for people coming from those sites? Are there any sites you know of that you would like to link to you? The \u201cWhat visitors look for\u201d section may identify topics visitors are interested in that your group has expertise in. Look for trends and outliers. In the \u201cTop content\u201d section, look for pages that are more popular than others or pages where people spend more time than average. Then, you can see what about that content could help to bring the rest of your content up to that level. One way to do this for pages is to look at the feedback on the page. Also look at the pageviews over time graph at the top of the dashboard for times when pageviews spiked. Do you know why the spike happened? Can you make that happen again? If you don\u2019t know where a spike in pageviews came from, try narrowing the date range for the dashboard to only that day and look at the \u201cWhere visitors come from\u201d section.","title":"How to interpret the data"},{"location":"managing-content/#review-of-terms","text":"Published : content that is visible to visitors to the site Unpublished : content that is hidden to visitors to the site.

Extension Communications News and Public Issues Team Extension Communications personnel on the News and Public Issues Team are responsible for managing news and gardening stories on the Extension website. New Stories This applies to new gardening stories and news that you write. Step 1: Publish to the OSU Newsroom . Note: This process is the same as before the new Extension website. Complete the workflow for publishing to the \u201cnewsroom,\u201d email lists, etc. Step 2: Wait for the story to be imported to the CMS The CMS imports stories from the newsroom every 6 hours. Step 3: Tag the story in the CMS The login link is located on the right side of the black section at the bottom of every page. Once logged in, go to the News Team Dashboard . The most recently imported stories are at the top of this list. To tag a story, click the \u201cEdit\u201d link in the same row as it appears in the dashboard, then open the \u201cStep 2\u201d section of the form that comes up: Fill out whatever topics, keywords, programs, and/or regions are appropriate and click \u201cSave\u201d at the bottom of the page. See the Tagging Guidelines section of this guide for more information on tagging. Stories from the Old Site All news and gardening stories that existed on the old Extension website when the new site launched have been imported into the new site. However, the old site did not have the tagging system that the new one does, so the tagging needs to be done manually to make that users are able to find old stories on the new site. There are two ways to tag old stories: either one at a time or in bulk. One at a Time Log in to the CMS and go to the News Team Dashboard . If necessary, search for a particular story by words contained in the title or body text. Click \u201cEdit\u201d next to the story you want to tag and tag as described above. Bulk Tagging If you want to tag many stories at once: Log in to the CMS and go to the News Team Dashboard . If necessary, search for a particular story by words contained in the title or body text. You can also filter to see only stories that do or don\u2019t already have certain tags filled out. Click the check boxes next to the stories that you want to tag. Select \u201cModify Tags\u201d from the dropdown above the list of stories and click the \u201cApply to Selected Items\u201d button. On the page that comes up, select the tag field that you would like to modify. Then, in the field that comes up, enter the tag that you would like to apply to the stories. In the \u201cOptions\u201d section Check the box if you want the tag you entered to be added alongside any existing tags the stories have. For example, if you enter the keyword \u201capples\u201d and one of the stories you selected already has the keyword \u201cpears,\u201d this will cause that story to have both keywords \u201capples\u201d and \u201cpears.\u201d Leave the box unchecked if you want the tag you entered to overwrite any existing tags the stories have. For example, if you enter the keyword \u201capples\u201d and one of the stories you selected already has the keyword \u201cpears,\u201d this will cause that story to only have the keyword \u201capples.\u201d Click \u201cApply\u201d at the bottom of the page. Extension Communications Pubs Team To copyedit content in the Extension website, you need to have the \"Content Editor\" role. All members of the Extension Communications pubs team should have this role. When you log in to the site, you will be taken to a dashboard that lists all content that has been assigned to you to copyedit . There are also tabs at the top of the page that show you lists of content has been copyedited and is pending approval as well as all content that hasn't been assigned to a copyeditor. Assigning content There are two ways to assign a piece of content to a content editor. You can assign the content to yourself when you edit it. To do this, open the \"Author and Publishing Information\" section of the content's edit screen and select yourself as the \"Copyeditor\" under \"Review and Copyediting\" You can assign the content to yourself or another person without editing it from the \"Unassigned\" tab of the dashboard. Check the box(es) next to the content you want to assign. At the top of the list of content, under \"Action\", select \"Assign\". Then click \"Apply to selected items\". Check the box for \"Copyeditor\" and select the name from the drop down list that appears. Then click \"Apply\". Assigning a piece of content to a person will remove it from the \"Unassigned\" list and add it to the list of assigned items they see when they log in. You can also see a list of all content that has been assigned to a copyeditor in the \"Assigned Content\" tab at the top of the page. Editing content To edit a piece of content, click on it in the list on the dashboard and click the \"Edit\" tab. Make your edits, enter any notes in the \"Revision log message\" box on the right-hand side of the screen, then click save at the bottom of the page. Just above the \"Save\" button, you will see a dropdown of options for the save state. Copyediting in progress : This saves a draft of your changes. It does not make the changes publicly visible and does not notify the group that the content has been copyedited. Copyedited and published : This makes your changes immediately visible to the public without approval from the group. Use this only for small changes such as spelling or formatting fixes and adding (non-topic) tags. Copyedited pending approval : This will trigger an email to the contact person for the group the content belongs to prompting them to approve the changes. Held for Review : This will make the content unpublished and not visible to the public. Use it for content that is currently not in a state that is appropriate for the website and needs to be reviewed or replaced by a content team/program coordinator.

See the Tagging Guidelines section of this guide for more information on tagging. Bulk Tagging If you want to tag many videos at once: Log in to the CMS and go to the Video Dashboard . If necessary, search for a particular video by words contained in the title or short description text.

To view just videos from the Extension Communications group, select \"Extension Communications\" then click the Apply button. Click the check boxes next to the videos that you want to tag. Select \u201cModify Tags\u201d from the dropdown above the list of stories and click the \u201cApply to Selected Items\u201d button.

Browsing the Website Every person uses the Internet with their own methods and style. Each of us reads, clicks, and searches differently. To support these differences and the preferences of our diverse Extension audience, the website provides multiple ways to find content: searching for content; finding content by browsing a topic-based menu; finding content through a participant-based program; and finding content through a county location. Search Research shows that more than half of all web users primarily use a site\u2019s search functionality to find content. Many visitors who start with menus and links switch to search if they can\u2019t find the content they want. The search box at the top of every page of the Extension website searches all content on the site. Improving search results There are two methods for a visitor to get more specific or relevant search results. Refine the search . The screenshot below shows the search results when you search for \u201capples.\u201d The top results are information about apple trees and their care. If you want information about preserving apples, you can change the search to \u201cpreserving apples.\u201d This would give more relevant results. Analytics show that about 30% of people who use search on the site \u201crefine\u201d their searches. Use the filters in the left sidebar of the search results page. The visitor in the previous example could open the \u201cFilter by Topic\u201d section and select \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d This will show only search results tagged with the topic \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d Screenshot showing the results when a visitor searches for \u201capples.\u201d Screenshot showing the results when a visitor searches for \u201capples\u201d and then filters results to show only items tagged with \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d Topic-Based Navigation The primary place for visitors to find educational content is on topic pages. This is because analytics and user testing show that people looking for educational content tend to use topic-based navigation first. To get to the topic pages, click \u201cTopics\u201d in the black navigation bar at the top of every page. Each topic has a \u201clanding page\u201d that is curated by a topic committee. This page contains the most important content for the topic and a description of the work Extension is doing in that area. It also links to several other pages that contain more content related to the topic. The visitor can click on a link on the landing page to go to the \u201cBrowse Resources\u201d page for that topic. This page lists all content in the system tagged with the topic in reverse chronological order (newest first). Like the search result page, filters on this page narrow the list to content relevant to the visitor. The resources page for the \u201cDairy\u201d topic shows all content tagged with the topic. Note the filters in the left sidebar that allow users to narrow the content they see on this page. Program-Based Navigation Visitors can find content related to an Extension program they are involved in through that program\u2019s pages. There are a few ways to get to these pages. Topic pages list programs that are related to that topic. County pages list programs that are active in that county. All programs are listed on a page in the top black menu bar under \u201cGet Involved.\u201d All program content can be found through the site\u2019s search. The program groups that maintain these pages have a lot of flexibility around how they can present content. For more information, see: Adding and Editing Content: Subpages and Organizing and Displaying Content on Other Pages . Location-Based Navigation Counties, like programs, maintain pages to organize and direct visitors toward content. People can find their county on the \u201cLocations\u201d page under \u201cFind Us\u201d in the top black menu bar. Case Study: Finding a Newsletter A newsletter called GROWING is published in Linn and Benton Counties. A person might find this newsletter on the Extension site in several ways. Search for \u201cgrowing\u201d and filter by Type \u201cNewsletter.\u201d Search for \u201cgrowing newsletter.\u201d Use the link on the Linn-Benton Master Gardener program page. Use the link on the Linn County page. Use the link on the Benton County page. Use the link on the \u201cBrowse Resources\u201d page for the Gardening Techniques topic. Since the newsletter was entered only once, updates will automatically show up in all these places. Making Changes to Content Logging In To make changes to content, content authors , people who enter content, must log in to the site. There is a \u201cLog in\u201d link at the bottom right of every page. This will take you to a screen where you use your ONID credentials to log in. When you are logged in, you will see a \u201cMy Groups\u201d link in the top black menu bar on every page. There are three pages to understand in order to use the back-end: the \u201cMy Groups\u201d page, the \u201cGroup Content\u201d page, and the \u201cEdit Screen.\u201d My Groups Page When you log in (or click on the \u201cMy Groups\u201d menu link), you will see your \u201cMy Groups Page.\u201d This page lists your groups. Your groups determine what types of content you can add and which pieces of content you have access to edit. My Groups Page example. If you need to be part of a group that isn\u2019t listed on your \u201cMy Groups\u201d page, get in touch with the leader of that group. See \u201cWorking with Other Content Authors\u201d for more information. Group Content Page Clicking on one of the group names will take you to the \u201c Group Content Page \u201d for that group. This page lists all the content that belongs to that group. Any member of the group can add and edit content for that group. The different types of content you can add to the group are listed as buttons across the top of the page. Group Content Page example. Edit Screen You will see the edit screen when adding or editing a piece of content. You can get to the edit screen in several ways: On the Group Content Page, find the content you want to edit and click the \u201cEdit\u201d button. Navigate to the desired page and click the \u201cEdit\u201d tab just under the title. To create a new piece of content, click one of the \u201cAdd\u201d buttons at the top of the Group Content page. How the edit page will look will vary by the type of content. Each are described in Adding and Editing Content . Edit Screen example. Using Edit Fields There are a couple of controls on edit screens that are important. Text Editor This field is used to enter text. Buttons at the top allow you to format the text. The \u201cFormat\u201d dropdown is for creating headings. You can also view the HTML for the text with the \u201cSource\u201d button. Use the buttons for only their intended purpose. For example, don\u2019t use headings to merely make text bigger or add emphasis. Similarly, don\u2019t use the subscript or superscript button to make text smaller. See the Accessibility section later in this guide for more information. Links To add a link , type and highlight the text you want to use as the link label and click the button in the text editor that looks like a chain link. This will open a small window. There are several ways to enter a link: To link to content that already exists on the site, start typing the name of the content. Matching titles will appear. Select the content you want to link to. To link to external content, copy and paste the URL. To link to an email address, enter \u201cmailto:(email address).\u201d To link to a specific section on the current page or another page, paste in the URL and add \u201c#(section-id)\u201d to the end. See Page Sections for more information. You can edit a link by placing your cursor inside the link and clicking on the link icon in the text editor. The same window will pop up where you can edit the link. When you create links in the text editor, it is very important that you periodically check that the links still work . Broken links on a website hurt an organization\u2019s credibility and might result in a penalty from search engines like Google, making content harder to find. We recommend using dynamically generated page sections, such as featured content or program tagged content lists, for linking to other content on the site when possible. These will automatically update when the content\u2019s link changes and so will never break. See Page Sections for more information. Content Browser For fields that allow you to reference an existing piece of content, you will see a button that says \u201cSelect Content.\u201d Clicking this button will open a new window called the content browser . Content browser. You can search for existing content by topic, region, seasonality, keyword, content type, group, and/or title. When you find the content you want to use, click the checkbox next to it. Then click the \u201cFinish\u201d button at the bottom of the window. Save the page for the selection to take effect. Page Sections When adding or editing certain kinds of content, including program and county pages, projects, and web-based newsletters, you will need to manage content on the page via page sections . With this method, you add pieces of content to the page in chunks, one section at a time. There are several different types of sections you can use for different kinds of content on the page. Some sections are for basic page elements such as text and images. Others create dynamic lists that pull content onto the page. These include county or program events lists (which pull events) and program resource lists (which pull program resources). Once you set up one of these sections, it will automatically show new content as it is entered without you needing to update the page. The types of page sections available depend on the type of content you are working on. See Adding and Editing Content for details about the type of sections available for each content type. You add page sections using the buttons at the bottom of the edit screen. Buttons to add page sections to a program page. You can reorder them by dragging them up and down the page using the arrow controls. This is often easier if you first click the \"Collapse All\" button above the page sections. Page Section Settings for Custom Design In the edit screen just above where you add and arrange page sections, there is a tab for \u201cSettings\u201d: When you switch to this tab, you will see the extra settings available for each section. The current available settings are: Section ID : This allows you to link to a specific section on a page. The ID should be a short, unique name with no spaces or punctuation besides dashes (-) or underscores (_). When you give a section an ID, you can link directly to that section by adding \u201c#SECTION_ID\u201d to the end of the subpage\u2019s URL. Background color : You can select a background color for the section that stretches all the way across the screen. The options are white or gray. \u201cCall to Action\u201d sections can also be black or orange. Alignment : For button links , you can have the button aligned to the left, right, or center of the page. List style : For sections that display content in a list (e.g. featured content and program resources lists), you can select the style to display each piece of content. You can choose between \u201cList,\u201d \u201cGrid,\u201d \"Feature Grid,\" or \u201cText List\u201d (see below). \u201cList\u201d style. \u201cGrid\u201d style. \u201cFeature Grid\u201d style. \u201cText List\u201d style.

These images are very short and wide, and how exactly they are cropped depends on the size of the screen the visitor is using. Here are some tips for choosing and uploading photos that work well as banner images. General tips Crop the image to 2000px wide by 325px tall before you upload it. This gives you more control over how the image is cropped, which otherwise the system would do automatically. Use the focal point control for the image to further control cropping. You can choose a specific point on the image to serve as a \u201cfocal point\u201d that will always be included when the image is cropped by the system. To change the focal point, edit the page where the banner images is uploaded and click the \u201cEdit\u201d button for the banner image. In the window that appears, there is a small crosshairs icon on the image preview. Click and drag the crosshairs to the desired focal point and save. Types of images that work well Landscapes that include the horizon Examples: Harney County , KBREC , SOREC , Hemp , Commercial Fishing Aerial views of a landscape Examples: Umatilla County Milton-Freewater , Union County Group photos with one or two rows of people lined up Examples: Tillamook County , Deschutes Co. 4-H , Lane Co. 4-H , Sherman Co. 4-H Photos containing multiple people or animals where their heads are lined up horizontally Livestock herds: Pasture and forages , Dairy , Horses , Swine 4-H members at fair: Malheur Co. 4-H , Union Co. 4-H Misc. examples: Land Steward Program , Lincoln Co.

User uploads photo and system saves the original version. When user saves photo, system generates cropped version (2000px X 325px) from the original uploaded file based on the focal point set for the image. Focal point is a set of two numbers (x, y), where x represents the horizontal position of the point as a percentage of the total width of the image (i.e. x=50 -> exactly halfway horizontally across the image, from the left) and y represents the vertical position of the point as a percentage of the total height of the image (i.e. y=50 -> exactly halfway vertically across the image, from the top). When a focal point (x,y ) is set, the system uses the following process to crop an image: Create a box the size the cropped image will be (in this case 2000px X 325px). Identify the point in the box x% across horizontally and y% across vertically. Resize the original image so that it is as close to the size of the box as possible while still covering it completely. Identify the point in the resized image x% across horizontally and y% across vertically. Lay the box on top of the resized image so that the two identified points are exactly on top of each other. Delete all of the resized image that is outside the box. The cropped image is what\u2019s left behind under the box. Note that you can skip this cropping step by manually resizing and cropping the image before you upload it. When a visitor views a page with a banner image, their web browser has to crop it in order to be exactly the width of their screen. It will use the same process as in step 2b above, except the size of the Box is not constant, it depends on the device the visitor is using.","title":"Tips for banner images on the Extension website"},{"location":"details/banner-images/#tips-for-banner-images-on-the-extension-website","text":"Banner images display on county, program, and project pages across the full width of the top of the page.

The bulk of text content on the Extension website is entered by content authors in one of these fields. Therefore, it is extremely important that content entered in them is accessible to all visitors to the website, including those with disabilities. Emphasized text (all-caps, bold, italic) Avoid text in all-caps. Screen readers (used by people who cannot see a screen well) may mistake it for an acronym and not read it correctly. Text in all-caps is also more difficult to read for people with conditions such as dyslexia, because all the letters are the same height. Avoid long passages of bold [B] or italicized [I] text. Similarly, this text is difficult to read for people with conditions like dyslexia. To emphasize information, the best technique is to \u201celiminate its competition\u201d i.e. make sure it is in a short paragraph, on a short page, etc. Do not use the \u2018Format\u2019 dropdown to enlarge/emphasize text. This control is specifically intended for section headings. If it is used incorrectly, screen readers and other assistive technology will not be able to interpret the page section correctly. Do not use bold [B] text as section headings. There is a dedicated control for section headings (see below). If it isn\u2019t used, screen readers and other assistive technology will not be able to interpret the page structure correctly. Headings and section breaks Use the \u2018Format\u2019 dropdown to create section headings. The top level headings in the text should use \u2018Heading 2\u2019, subheadings under those \u2018Heading 3\u2019, etc. Do not skip heading levels. Section headings in long text are extremely helpful for readability and accessibility. Do not use horizontal lines as the only section break indicator. As a visual element, these are not accessible to people who aren\u2019t looking at the screen. Use headings instead of/in addition to horizontal lines. Links Do not use the URL as the link label. The \u201clink label\u201d refers to the text that a visitor clicks on to follow the link. The link label needs to be pronounceable in order for people using screen readers and other assistive technology in order to use them. Do not use generic link labels like \u201cclick here\u201d or \u201cwebsite\u201d. People using screen readers or other assistive technology often get links out of the context of their surrounding text. The link label by itself should describe what the link goes to (e.g. the title of the page being linked to). Avoid multiple links on the same page with the same link label. Similarly, people need to be able to figure out where a link goes when it is outside the context of its surrounding text. An example would be if you had a list of resources and a link for each with the label \u201cRead more\u201d. Better link labels would be \u201cRead more about\u2026\u201d Lists (numbered and bulleted) All lists should have bullets or numbers. Don\u2019t use tables or plain line breaks to create a \u201clist\u201d without bullets/numbers. Use the bulleted/numbered list controls in the text editor to create lists. You should never have to type the bullets/numbers manually. Tables Avoid tables whenever possible. Tables are the most difficult type of web page content to make accessible. They are intended only for tabular data, not for creating a layout for text or a list. Avoid \u201ccomplex\u201d tables even more. This refers to tables with cells that span multiple rows and/or columns. If you need to include a table, contact Extension Communications for help. Other controls (footnotes, pull quotes, and blockquotes) Use the footnote control [a1] to create footnotes that are linked to at the bottom of the page. The superscript control [x2] should only be used for mathematical equations, etc. Use the pull quote control to create a pull quote , which is text that is enlarged and \u201cpulled out\u201d of the flow of the text like in a magazine. This control looks like one vertical line with several horizontal lines to the right. It\u2019s between the blockquote [\u201c] and horizontal line controls.
