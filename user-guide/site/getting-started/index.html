<p>When you have content that you want to put online, you first need to figure out where it belongs. Your groups determine what content you can enter and edit in the Extension website.</p>
<h2 id="options-on-where-to-put-the-content">Options on Where to Put the Content</h2>
<p><strong>All content that is going to be included in Extension’s digital strategy going forward must be entered in the Extension website.</strong> This includes most, but not all, of Extension’s existing web content.</p>
<p>However, the Extension website is <em>not</em> a good place for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extension faculty and staff resources</li>
<li>Historical documents or reference materials. Use Box or archive as appropriate.</li>
<li>Content that needs work. Content should conform to the website’s guiding principles, described in the introduction to this guide. Before adding content to the new site, review and/or revise to ensure accuracy. Revise or redesign to ensure it is on brand.</li>
<li>Volunteer resources. A separate website solution is being discussed. For now, a combination of the Extension website and Box is a likely solution. When your team is ready to add volunteer content, please let us know. Together, we can decide on the best short-term solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several options for content that doesn't go on the Extension website. See <a href="../getting-help/">Getting Help</a> if you need help choosing the best method for your content.</p>

<h2 id="your-groups">Your Groups</h2>
<p>Your groups assigned in the website determine what content you are allowed to edit. When someone in your a group creates a piece of content, you and anyone in that group can edit it.</p>
<p>When you are a member of a group, the <em>type</em> of group determines what <em>type</em> of content you can add. There are four types of groups on the site.</p>
<ul>
<li>Content Team</li>
<li>Program Team</li>
<li>County Office Team</li>
<li>Topic Committee (representatives from different content teams)</li>
</ul>
<p>A person may be a member of several groups with different group types, so it is important to understand what content belongs in what group.</p>
<p><img alt="Group Types Venn Diagram" src="../images/group-types.png" /></p>
<p><em>Types of groups and how they overlap.</em></p>
<h3 id="content-teams">Content Teams</h3>
<p>Content teams are responsible for <em>entering educational content, including region specific content</em>. They can also add events and newsletters if not already added by another team.</p>
<p>Content entered by Content Teams primarily displays on topic pages on the Extension website (e.g. the Dairy topic page). A single content team may enter content for multiple topics. Likewise, a single topic page may show content entered by multiple groups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extension catalog publications are already added to the Extension website by Extension Communications so you don’t have to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="program-groups">Program Groups</h3>
<p>Program groups are responsible for <em>entering materials that visitors need to join or participate in their program (e.g. Master Woodland Managers)</em>.</p>
<p>On the Extension website, they can also feature educational content entered by a Content Team that is especially relevant to members of their program or point people to the relevant topic pages.</p>
<p>Program groups do not represent the seven Extension program areas, institutes, centers, nor industry/discipline programs. They are ways for the public to get involved in programming like Master Beekeeper or Walk with Ease.</p>
<p>For most programs, a single statewide group enters content (e.g. Better Bones and Balance). However, programs that differ significantly by county may have a separate group for each of their local programs (e.g. Benton County 4-H). This also requires having enough county-based staff to support content maintenance.  </p>
<p>Program teams will enter most of their content as “program resources”. Each of these represents an individual form, file, or link. They can organize these on “subpages” on the Extension website. Program groups can also enter events, newsletters, and announcements that are of interest to members of their program.</p>
<h3 id="county-office-groups">County Office Groups</h3>
<p>County office groups are responsible for <em>entering content about their office’s physical location and services provided, highlighting the activities going on at the office, and directing visitors to relevant educational and program content</em>. This also includes the combined stations.</p>
<p>County office groups can create events, announcements and newsletters. They can also set up local focus areas on the Extension website. These serve as a link between the county and a topic or program that is of particular interest to visitors from that county. For example, a county on the coast could describe their work with coastal issues and link to educational content about marine wildlife. Combined stations may also link to the corresponding Agricultural Experiment Station research pages on the College of Agricultural Sciences website.</p>
<h3 id="topic-committees">Topic Committees</h3>
<p>Topic Committees are responsible for deciding what content to feature on the topic page they are in charge of (e.g. Beef Cattle). This may involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifying the various audiences the topic is aimed at and their questions</li>
<li>highlighting high quality, important, or seasonally relevant content for that topic</li>
<li>setting up keyword standards for content in that topic</li>
<li>establishing a content schedule for the topic page content</li>
</ul>
<p>They may also write some text for topic pages that describes Extension’s work in a particular area. As a committee, they do not enter pieces of content themselves.</p>
<p>Most members of topic committees will also be members of a content team. However, it is not necessary to be on a content team (or any other group) to be on a topic committee.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="case-study-groups-for-a-master-gardener-coordinator">Case Study: Groups for a Master Gardener Coordinator</h4>
<p>Say that in county X, there is a single person that acts as a Master Gardener volunteer coordinator. This employee develops educational materials as well as forms and other materials for volunteers.</p>
<p>This person would be a member of (at least) two groups.</p>
<ol>
<li>The “Home Horticulture” content team: They would use this group to enter their educational gardening content, since gardening information is relevant to people outside the program too, not just participants.</li>
<li>The “Master Gardener – X County” program team: They would use this group to enter the program materials for Master Gardeners in their county. They could also display educational content that their volunteers would find useful.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>It is helpful to know not only your website groups, but the roles of all people involved in OSU Extension's digital strategy. This can show you where to get support. Current responsibilities have focused on the Extension website, although it is just one piece of the long-term plans.</p>

<h2 id="content-types">Content Types</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction to this guide, it is important that content have structure for Extension’s digital strategy to work. A <strong>content type</strong> is how we structure a piece of content. Examples on the Extension website are articles, events, newsletters, and videos. Each content type has different fields to fill out when entering it.</p>
<p>The content types that you are able to use depend on the group type you are using.</p>
